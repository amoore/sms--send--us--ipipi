SMS::Send::AU::MyVodafone - An SMS::Send driver for the myvodafone.com.au website

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Get the sender and login
  my $sender = SMS::Send->new('AU::MyVodafone',
  	_login    => '04 444 444', # Whitespace is ignored
  	_password => 'abcdefg',
  	);
  
  # Send a message to ourself

  	text => 'Messages have a limit of 160 chars',
  	to   => '+61 4 444 444',
  	);
  
  # Did it send?

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SMS::Send::AU::MyVodaphone> is an regional L<SMS::Send> driver for
Australia that delivers messages via the L<http://myvodafone.com.au>
website Web2TXT feature.

Using your phone number as a login, and your existing password, this
driver allows any Australian with a Vodafone to send SMS messages (with
the message cost added to your account).

=head2 Preparing to Use This Driver

As well as setting up your myvodfone.com.au account and password, the
Web2TXT feature requires acceptance of an additional disclaimer and
conditions of use form.

You C<must> manually accept this disclaimer and conditions before you
will be able to use this driver.

While we certainly could make the driver do it for you, acceptance
of the terms of use implies you understand the cost structure and
rules surrounding the use of the Web2TXT feature.

=head2 Disclaimer

Other than dieing on encountering the terms of use form, no other
protection is provided, and the authors of this driver take no
responsibility for any costs accrued on your phone bill by using
this module.

Using this driver will cost you money. B<YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED>

# Constructor

=pod

=head2 new

  # Create a new sender using this driver
  my $sender = SMS::Send->new(
  	_login    => '04 444 444',
  	_password => 'abcdefg',
  	);

The C<new> constructor takes two parameters, which should be passed
through from the L<SMS::Send> constructor.

The params are driver-specific for now, until L<SMS::Send> adds a standard
set of params for specifying the login and password.

=over

=item _login

The C<_login> param should be your phone number. That is, the phone to send
from and to be billed to for the messages.

The login should be an Australian-format number. That is, starting with
zero-four "04".

=item _password

The C<_password> param should be your myvodafone.com.au password.

=back

During construction, the driver will actively log in to the
myvodafone.com.au website using the credentials provided, to verify
they are correct.

It will not check for your acceptance of the terms and conditions at
this point. That is done at C<send_sms>-time.

Returns a new C<SMS::Send::AU::MyVodafone> object, or dies on error.
