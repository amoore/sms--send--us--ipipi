SMS-Send-Ipipi
===========================

This README is a very bare skeleton. Please see the POD documentation
found in the Ipipi.pm module included in the distribution.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Since ipipi.com is a pay service, the test suite does not actually use
it to send any text messages. If you would like to test that
capability, you should set three environment variables:

IPIPI_LOGIN - your ipipi.com username
IPIPI_PASSWORD - your ipipi.com password
IPIPI_DESTINATION - a mobile phone number to send a text message to.

Then, run 'make test' again and a text message will be sent.
